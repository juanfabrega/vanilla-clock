# Vanilla Clock
A simple clock built using vanilla JS.

# Purpose
This project is part of the javascript 30 code challenge, to build 30 small apps using only vanilla JS.

# Future Improvements
Current build has a slight jitter on the clock hands when the second hand passes the 12-o-clock point. Need to improve upon this.
